 Assessing Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering Combinations for Image Analysis
 
This research investigates clustering in image data analysis, focusing specifically on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of various fashion items, each with a resolution of 28x28 pixels. The research addresses the high-dimensional nature of image classification by employing a systematic approach to dimensionality reduction, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Stacked Autoencoder (SAE), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). PCA is used to transform the data into a space with fewer dimensions while retaining most variance, SAE for learning a compressed representation in an unsupervised manner, and t-SNE for its ability to preserve local structures in a reduced dimension space. The study then examines clustering through algorithms such as MiniBatch KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering. MiniBatch KMeans is chosen for its efficiency with large datasets, DBSCAN for its capability to detect clusters of varied shapes, and Agglomerative Clustering for its approach to hierarchical clustering. The efficacy of these methods is thoroughly evaluated using several metrics: the Calinski-Harabasz index for cluster validity based on within-cluster variance, the Davies-Bouldin index for average similarity between each cluster and its closest counterpart, the Silhouette index for measuring the closeness of data points within their cluster compared to other clusters, and the adjusted Rand index for quantifying clustering accuracy against a known set of ground truth labels. The findings from this detailed analysis reveal varying performances in clustering, illuminating the intricate balance and interplay between dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering algorithms. This research not only enhances understanding of clustering dynamics in image data but also paves the way for future investigations in machine learning and data analysis, focusing on refining and optimizing these methodologies for more effective application.
